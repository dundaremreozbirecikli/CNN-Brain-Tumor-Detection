# CNN-Based Brain Tumor Detection

## Introduction

This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a powerful deep learning model designed for image classification, to automate the diagnosis of different brain tumors from MRI scans. The objective is to classify MRI images into one of the following categories:

- Glioma
- Meningioma
- Pituitary
- No Tumor
