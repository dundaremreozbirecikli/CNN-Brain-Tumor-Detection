# CNN-Brain-Tumor-Detection

## Introduction

This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning model particularly well-suited for image classification tasks, to automatically diagnose different types of brain tumors (glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor) from MRI scans.
